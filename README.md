## Development Server
Start node server via `node ./app.js`

## Production Server
It should be running by default. To verify the 'app' process is running, use `pm2 list`.
If you need to start up the app, use `pm2 start app.js`
Further documentation lives in my Evernote notebook for cristin.io deployments.
